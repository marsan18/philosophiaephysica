%
% Usage:
%   data =  noisechar(seconds, drive, range)
%   Where,
%   seconds = desired duration of the data acquisition
%   drive = a 1x3 vector specifying the constant voltage that is to be put
%            on [x y z] channels of the stage
%   range = a number specifying bipolar range of the analog input board (ADC). 
%           e.g. providing 5 = range, sets the range to be -5 to +5 volts.
%           Reducing the range increases the resolution of ADC board.
%           However, 'drive' signals should be within this range.

%From the visual C++ program - Laser Tracker (which has access
%to board parameter configuration that is deeper (lower level) than matlab has), 
%we know that when we ask board to provide sample rate of 10 KHz on 8
%channels, it actually gives rate of 9615 Hz per channel. 
%This is calculated from the raw numbers provided from the board as below.
%
%Board PCI-6052E operates in multiplexing mode, meaning that if multiple channels are
% configured to be scanned, then they will be sampled successively and not simultaneously. 
%For the discussion below, Sample Interval is the time between sampling of
%successive channels in one scan-sequence. Scan Interval is time
%between completion of one scan-sequence and start of the next scan-sequence
% Board gives:
%"Sample Time Base" = 1 
%   -> which corresponds to the clock frequency used for sample interval-> 1 MHz = 1 us resolution 
%"Sample Interval" = 13 -> 13 us sample inverval
%"Scan Time Base" = 1 -> 1 us resolution clock used for calculating scan-interval
%"Scan Interval" = 0  -> No delay between successive scan-sequences
%
%These numbers give total time for execution of one scan sequence with 8 channels as
%T = Nchannel*SampleInterval + ScanInterval = 8*13 + 0 = 104 microseconds
%This is the same as time between successive sampling of the same channel.
%So samle rate per channel = 1/T = 9615.38 Hz.
%
%It is surprising that when we ask board to give 10KHz sample rate through
%matlab, the matlab gives the data actually at 10 KHz rate, instead of 9615 Hz
%So matlab is either processing (interpolating etc) the raw data OR it is
%sampling the data at next higher sample rate (that is available from
%board) than the requested, and then just picks the data points separated
%at the interval corresponding to requested sampleRate.
%
%If we ask for the same sample rate that we know board can provide, then we
%are sure that matlab is not doing any processing with that raw data. So,
%we must use 9615 as our sample rate.
%
%Also, if the desired sampling rate is anything other than 10000 (for e.g. 20000), the magic
%number 9615 should be replaced by a new number, which can be calculated by
%hand or, can be found using VC++ program.
