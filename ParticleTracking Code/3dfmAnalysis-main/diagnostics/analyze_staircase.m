% This function analyzes "staircase" datasets, where a staircase shaped 
% step-input is applied to one or more axes of the Mad City Labs stage.  
% Immobilized objects (e.g. beads) are tracked via video-feed and the 
% resulting video-tracking data serves as the output.  Using input and
% output data streams, some measurements are made to estimate noise and
% tracking quality.
%  
%  [v] = analyze_staircase(stagefile, videofile, videofps);  
%   
%  where "stagefile" is *.mcl.mat filename containing MCL and QPD data
%        "videofile" is *.vrpn.mat filename containing tracked video data
%		     "videofps"  is frames_per_second of camera
