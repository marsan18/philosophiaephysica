Superfine Lab: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill

This repository contains (mostly) MATLAB analysis code for several projects in the Superfine Lab in the Physics department at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, including but not limited to:

- Particle tracking
- Passive and active particle microrheology
- Magnetic tweezers, i.e. 3d Force Microscopy (3DFM)
- High-throughput microscopy 

Much of this is legacy code, migrated here for documentation and refactoring purposes.
