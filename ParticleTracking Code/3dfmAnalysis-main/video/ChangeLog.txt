2005-12-14  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* raw_balance_gain.m: for a raw video, this balances the gain values for both channels in each pulnix raw image and saves a new raw file.

2005-12-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2005-11-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2005-11-15   Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* raw_mean_subtract.m added. performs mean subtraction from a .raw file and saves a new .raw file

2005-11-15  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2005-05-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* raw2img.m: fixed a bug that offset the frame number by one.

2005-05-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2004-12-07  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* balance_pulnix_gains.m: added.  sometimes the image looks banded even after the line-swapping problem is confirmed fixed.  The gains between the two channels on the Pulnix may be off.  You can actually fix this in the camera (where I'm headed after I finish with the data I've already taken).

2004-12-06  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* mip.m: fixed off-by-one error in frame id.

2004-12-01  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* Removed make_pulnix_movie.

2004-09-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
