2006-08-23 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* fsanalysis_subgui.m:	Now supports analysis of data that was taken with control-frequency bursts interleaved between test-freqeuncy bursts.

2006-06-30 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:	Now automatically exports results of msd to base workspace. Also plots msd on loglog scale instead of linearized log scale.
	
2006-06-22 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:	
	- Now handles the box modes appropriately when the main figure is closed and then reploted by user.
	- Better handling of signal variety for time domain plot in stack mode.
	- Fixed a bug whereby time domain plot for stack wouldn't update if the box was partially out of axes limits.

	* lt_analysis_gui.m:	Several bug fixes in the newly added features.

2006-06-16 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:	
	- Now plots a flag-line if & when the time stamps are unevenly spaced.
	- Added a list of markers that can be looped through (in addition of colors) when overlaying several datasets.

	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig:	
	- Fixed a bug while loading a file that is already loaded in the database.
	- Now shows 'red' background while busy computing, so that user doesn't accidentally click everywhere.
	- Fixed a typo where instead of disabling 'overlay mags' functionality, program enabled it causing a crash later on.

2006-06-09 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:	
	- Fixed a bug in plotting spectrogram in log scale. Also, default view is set back to looking down from top, since 3D view wasn't much helpful.
	- Commented out the code for plotting energy vs time. Will add back after putting a checkbox in the advanced option window.
	- Fixed the annoying delay that happened when trying to draw a new box when one box already exists. Now first deletes the old box before switching to 'drag box' mode.

2006-06-09 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig:
	- Added a button to let user clear the stack created using 'plot freq domain results for this box in the stack' button.

	- Now spectrogram is plotted as a surface (instead of colormap) and in log scale.
	- Commented out overlaying of position data on spectrogram, doesn't go well with surface.
	- Added a routine that computes and plots energy vs time. This may just be temporary.

2006-06-06 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Now uses 'bone' colormap instead of 'gray' for spectrogram.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: minor cosmetic changes.

2006-06-06 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:

2006-05-18 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* fsanalysis_subgui.m, fsanalysis_subgui.fig:
	- fixed a bug in shifting the under-hood frequency window
	- Now shows harmonic markers for excitation frequency, while looking underh the hood

	- several other bug fixes.
2006-05-17 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* partial commit. Need to switch computer.

	- Added a checkbox to let user specify if the stage position needs to be filtered or not, at the time of loading the file itself.
	- Added ability to view spectrogram. (only one file at a time, no overlay). Useful to quickly diagnose frequency sweep data.
	- Removed frequency response checkbox. A whole new sub-gui serves its purpose now.
	- several other minor modifications here and there.

	* fsanalysis_subgui.m, fsanalysis_subgui.fig:
	- The subgui for frequency sweep analysis, that can be called from lt_analysis_gui.

2006-05-03 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
		- Added ability to attach frequency-sweep excitation data with tracker log. 
		- Made some progress towards processing frequency sweep data, left incomplete.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: Some cosmetic improvements and disambiguation.
2006-04-28 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Turned off 'pretty_plot' command for main figure. According to profiler it was taking a long time to execute. Should came back to it and find out why.

2006-04-21 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Turned off filtering of stage. Untill this option is made accessible through GUI, filtering would have to be done manually. Automatic filtering seems to be a bad idea when tracking is lost and the originial file contains uneven time-stamps for a small span.

2006-04-21 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Sets and supplies correct flags to load new or edited files. Comaptible with load_laser_tracking 02.01
2006-04-14 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Offset in the .drift. field is now set to zero, so that dependent codes don't have to add it back manually while subtracting drift using 'polyval'. Related changes allover.

2006-04-13 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m:
	- Fixed a bug so where 'magdata' field was left empty when there was no magnet data attached to it. Now defaults to zero.
	- Does not automatically refresh the main figure window when switching to different files. Refreshing takes a while and gets annoying if not intended.

2006-04-11 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig: 
	- Loads and saves files correctly

2006-03-05 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m, lt_analysis_gui.fig: 
	- Now doesn't refresh time-domain plots automatically when any setting is changed. Added a separate button for that.
	- Incorporated msdbase code (soon to be committed) into gui.
2006-01-28 Kalpit Desai <kvdsai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Now asks user for confirmation when a file in the 'to load list' is already loaded in the data base. Eliminates need of first removing the file and reloading it when changing the experiment type.
	- Fixed a bug in plotting of multiples PSDs of lowbandwidth dat2
	- Fixed a crash that happened when user 'cancelled' edits of tag.
	- Now 'Cut' allows to select a point outside axis as the boundary. Useful when we want to remove all the data before or after certain time.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: 'Overlay Ch 8' renamed to 'Overlay Mags'

2006-01-27 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Now loglog plots are plotted taking log of the signal first and then plotting on linear axis.

	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Fixed several bugs with PSD computation and plotting
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig: All fonts are now 8 points, this makes it look right on Tim's laptop. 

2006-01-04 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Fixed the bug where program crashed while trying to 3d-plot empty data.
	- Fixed the behaviour of dragging box after zoom
	- Now prints the results on command line in addition of displaying it.

2006-01-04 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added ability to play sound for the data selected inside box
	- Also plots a spectrogram of the signal while playing the sound.
	* lt_analysis_gui.fig
	- Added button for playing sound
	- Added a frame, using to mask the controls when program is busy and needs to avoid accidental clicks.

	* lt_analysis_gui.m: Added a check for empty database in couple of places.

2005-12-26 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Replaced the referenced fieldnames of the global database with absolute names, thus improving readability of the code and  speed of the program. Referencing was useful only while the absolute names were in experimental phase.
	- Fixed a typo.

2005-12-23 Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* lt_analysis_gui.m: 
	- Added back the ability to compute psd, compute 'accumulative displacement' and overlay the results for multiple files on a common plot. Enabled 'plot' button.
