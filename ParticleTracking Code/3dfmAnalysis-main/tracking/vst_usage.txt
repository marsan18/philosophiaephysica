       -nogui: Run without the video display window (no Glut/OpenGL)
       -gui: Run with the video display window (no Glut/OpenGL)
       -kernel: Use kernels of the specified type (default symmetric).
       -rod3: Make a rod3 kernel of specified LENGTH(pixels) & ORIENT(degrees)
       -image: set averaged test image over a number of FRAMES (default 0, which
               only uses the initial test image, not changing it at each frame)
       -imageor: set orientation of tracker to specified ORIENT(degrees)
               and averaged test image over a number of FRAMES (default 0, which
               only uses the initial test image, not changing it at each frame)
       -dark_spot: Track a dark spot (default is bright spot)
       -follow_jumps: Set the follow_jumps flag
       -outfile: Save the track to the file 'name' (.vrpn will be appended)
       -precision: Set the precision for created trackers to P (default 0.05)
       -sample_spacing: Set the sample spacing for trackers to S (default 1)
       -show_lost_and_found: Show the lost_and_found window on startup
       -lost_behavior: Set lost tracker behavior: 0:stop; 1:delete; 2:hover
       -blur_lost_and_found: Set blur_lost_and_found to B (default 0, which is off)
       -center_surround: Set center_surround behavior radius for lost and found to R (default 0, which is off)
       -optimization_off: turn off optimization (optimization is allowed by default)
       -lost_tracking_sensitivity: Set lost_tracking_sensitivity to L
       -intensity_lost_sensitivity:Set intensity_lost_tracking_sensitivity to L
       -dead_zone_around_border: Set a dead zone around the region of interest
                 edge within which new trackers will not be found
       -dead_zone_around_trackers: Set a dead zone around all current trackers
                 within which new trackers will not be found
       -first_frame_autofind: Autofind beads in first frame, then not afterwards
       -maintain_fluorescent_beads: Try to autofind up to M fluorescent beads at every
                 if there are not that many already.
       -fluorescent_spot_threshold: Set the threshold for possible spots when
                 autofinding.  0 means the minimum intensity in the image, 1 means the max.
                 Setting this lower will not miss as many spots,
                 but will also find garbage (default 0.5)
       -fluorescent_max_regions: Only check up to FR connected regions per frame
       -maintain_this_many_beads: Try to autofind up to M beads at every frame
                 if there are not that many already.
       -candidate_spot_threshold: Set the threshold for possible spots when
                 autofinding.  Setting this lower will not miss as many spots,
                 but will also find garbage (default 5)
       -sliding_window_radius: Set the radius of the global SMD sliding window
                 neighborhood.  Higher values of SR may cause some spots to
                 take longer before they are detected, but will greatly
                 increase the running speed (default 9)
       -radius: Set the radius to use for new trackers to R (default 5)
       -tracker: Create a tracker with radius R at pixel X,Y and initiate
                 optimization.  Multiple trackers can be created
       -FIONA_background: Set the default background for FIONA trackers to BG
                 (default 0)
       -raw_camera_params: Set parameters in case we're opening a raw file
                 (default throws a dialog box to ask you for them)
       -load_state: Load program state from FILE
       -log_video: Log every Nth frame of video (in addition to every tracker every frame)
       -continue_from: Load trackers from last frame in the specified CSV FILE and continue tracking
       -append_from: Load trackers from last frame in the specified CSV FILE with
                 ability to continue tracking and to add further log data to the
                 same file.
       -check_bead_count_interval: Interaval in frames to check whether the current bead count is low.
       -enable_internal_values: Output the regions sizes (pixels) and the sensitivity values for each tracker used in fluorescent autofind to the .csv file.
       -lost_all_colliding_trackers: When trackers get too close, mark all of them lost instead of leaving one behind.
       source: The source file for tracking can be specified here (default is
                 a dialog box)
