	* filter_video_tracking.m:  added viscosity filter.
	* remove_drift.m: repaired commit collisions and moved plotting code to new location.

2013.07.10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m:  added drift velocity in pixels/sec as an output.
	* filter_video_tracking.m:  now reports drift velocity to console.

2013.05.17  Christian Stith <chstith@ncsu.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: updated to implement optional frame rate input.

2013.02.25  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* filter_video_tracking.m:  implemented minimum viscosity filter that will remove trackers that exhibit Newtonian behavior at viscosities less than the min_visc value.  Useful for eliminating beads diffusing in solvent while interesting beads are those that are attached to cells. 

2012-12-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* filter_video_tracking.m:  implemented max_pixel_range filter to get rid of unattached/diffusing beads in cell experiments.

	* load_video_tracking.m:  fixed bug where an empty 'first file' in a list would abandon any data loaded from subsequent files in the list.
	* remove_drift.m:  fixed bug where large empty periods in a movie would corrupt the fitting parameters.  Fixed by reducing the complexity of the algorithm.  It doesn't generalize to any drift function anymore, it patently assumes a linear drift (constant velocity).

2011-09-27  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* filter_video_tracking.m:  fixed the default values for all filters to reflect conditions such that each filter was not run at all.

2011-07-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: can now input a vector as the calibum parameter for converting pixels to microns.  An error is thrown if the number of input files does not equal the number of calibum values.

2011-07-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: can now handle input filenames as the type of structure array outputted by matlab's 'dir'.

2010-09-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: replaced center-of-mass algorithm with one that doesn't care about trackers popping in and out of existence.  It estimates the center-of-mass velocity for adjacent frames that have consistent trackers.  Still only works for samples with linear drift.

2009-10-06  rspero@physics.unc.edu
	* Added data filters to load_video_tracking to delete based on minPixelRange, minFrames, tCrop, and xyCrop

	* remove_drift.m: function now terminates gracefully when input is empty.

2006-08-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: turns out that those diff tags were not the only thing cvs added to my file because of a conflict.  It copied the entire function.  This confused me until Kalpit set me straight.  Everything should be functioning correctly now (har har).

2006-08-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* remove_drift.m: removed cvs diff tag information that was mistakenly incorporated into file.

2006-08-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	- This is possible for only a limited set of circumstances e.g. EITHER bead & error signal OR stage have to be present in saved file.
	- Fixed documentation.

2006-06-15  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* load_laser_tracking.m:
	- For .edited format, now stores the name at the time of loading as the current name of the file.

2005-09-22  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: fixed filter on older spot_tracker .vrpn.mat files.  Fixed logentry that liked to repeat itself.

2005-09-16  Jeremy Cribb  <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:  new cvs updates of load_vrpn_tracking has inserted lines between code.  Removed these extra lines, because the actually break the code.

	* load_video_tracking.m: MAJOR CHANGES to output format.  Prior to this version, load_video_tracking outputted a matrix that required all beads to exist for all times; zeros were used as placeholders.  This was changed to reflect Video Spot Tracker's output more truthfully.  Also added support for '.evt.mat' data format.
	* get_bead.m: added.  Extracts a specific bead's data from new load_video_tracking.

2005-04-06	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>

2004-08-22	Jeremy Cribb	<jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* load_video_tracking.m: Repaired documentation (did not explain relative/absolute position choice in parameter list)

2004-06-26	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>

2004-06-18	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: Reduced the tolerance level for finding correct clipping points for low bandwidth data to 0.0005 seconds from 0.05 seconds. Provides more precise clipping.

2004-06-17	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tjoin.m: Fixed a bug that was throwing out the meta-data information when two datasets being joined are themselves result of two/more datasets previously joined.

2004-06-17	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Added default storing of uct_offset (universal coordinated time of first sample) within info.orig

	* load_vrpn_tracking: 
	- Added feature to select displacement units (meters|microns) of position error, stage reports and bead positions. Previously, this was only possible for stage commands
	- Fixed the bug of getting weird first entry in position error log, messing up the whole data set when offset is being subtracted out. This was happening because we don't have jacobian available for first position error, so using default jacobian. Fixed it by discarting the first sample.

2004-06-11	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m: Added an arguement to select if we want to remove the offset from computed bead positions. Also re-commented the whole header to make consitent with updates.
	* tclip.m: just renamed the flag 'save' to 'fsave' to avoid using reserved keywords.

2004-05-20	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m: Subtract off the time-offset before plotting graphs.

2004-05-19	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* tclip.m: added feature to let user specify if the resultant file needs to be automatically saved.

2004-05-19	Kalpit Desai	<kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- Do not try saving the file name when data is supplied in form of a matlab variable.
	- changed XYZunits options to 'u' and 'm', this used to be 'um' and 'm', creating ambiguity.
	
	* plot_vrpn_tracking.m:
	- replaced '.stage.' with '.stageCom.', to accord with changes in load_vrpn_tracking.m				

2004-05-18  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@cs.unc.edu>
	* load_vrpn_tracking.m : Fixed the comment about default 'time' argument - should have been 'uct'

2004-05-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* Initial Version
