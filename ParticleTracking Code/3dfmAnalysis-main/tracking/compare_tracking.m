%
% CISMM function  
% Tracking 
% 
% This function reads in two tracking datasets from Video Spot Tracker, and
% them compares them for differences in tracking data and reports the data
% in an output table that includes ID mismatches and absence/presence in
% domain A or B, where fileA is considered the base reference (ground
% truth);
% 
% [q] = compare_tracking(fileA, fileB, id_error_thresh, xy_error_thresh)
%  
% where "q" is the tabulated results of the comparison
%       "fileA" is the "ground truth" tracking file
%       "fileB" is the tracking file to be compared to fileA
%       "id_error_thresh" is the error threshold for identifying a tracker
%         in A and a tracker in B as 'mismatched', i.e. where the distance
%         between their starting positions is greater than the threshold. The
%         threshold is defined in pixels with a default of 1, meaning the
%         starting positions for a trajectory must be more than 1 pixel apart
%         from A to B in order for it to be labeled as "mismatched"
%       "xy_error_thresh" is the error threshold for all xy locations
%         between matched trajectories in A and B. Here the default is 0.1,
%         meaning that is the standard deviation of the differences between
%         two matching trajectories exceeds 0.1 pixels, then the trajectory
%         (i.e. its tracking) in B fails to sufficiently match the
%         corresponding/matched tracker ID in A.
