Hey,

So, I've put the bayesian code in:

\\nsrg.cs.unc.edu\nanodata2\cribb\FROM LUKE

I also put a directory with the construct expt from the other week.  You should be able to run bayes_process.m (described below) from within this directory and the code will work.  Rename the current "bayes_analysis" folder so that it does not get written over.

So I tried to add clarifying things to bayesian html output.  I think it's self-explanatory -- but I am also pretty sure I've looked at that output so much that I am not seeing it fresh.

Definitely let me know if you have questions.  Getting it running will help with seeing what is going on.  To do that do the following:

-- cd into directory that contains panoptes output of aggregated datasets:  filename.vrpn.evt.mat files
-- A better version of file_re_name_order.m is needed to rename to conditions to 2 letter names (helps with graphs) and in an order that is the same for each experiment
-- run bayes process.m, shown below

dataout = bayes_process(num_subtraj, frame_rate, calibum, metadata, k_norm)

I typically use:

num_subtraj = 60
frame_rate = 32
calibum = 0.152
metadata is a structure as shown:  (a field for each condition in the expt)

metadata.bead_radius(1) = 1E-6;
metadata.bead_radius(2) = 1E-6;
metadata.bead_radius(3) = 1E-6;
metadata.bead_radius(4) = 1E-6;
metadata.bead_radius(5) = 1E-6;
metadata.bead_radius(6) = 1E-6;

k_norm --> a number referring to the condition you want bar plots normalized to.  E.g.  if you rename files such that construct control (CC) is the second .vrpn.evt.mat file read, k_norm =2


Again, don't hesitate with questions.
