% Computes mean-square displacements for varying window-length (Tau)
% from given time vs position data.
%  
% USAGE:
%
%  [msd, Tau] = msdbase(tpos, tau)  
%  [msd, Tau, ste_d, ste_t, count] = msdbase(tpos, tau)
%   
% Inputs:
%   tpos: matrix with N rows and D+1 columns containing coordinates of 
%         N points in D dimensions, with timestamps in the first column. 
%         Sample rate is considered to be the mean time interval between 
%         successive samples. If data is not evenly sampled it would be 
%         resampled at double of the original mean sample rate using linear
%         interpolation. 
%            
%   tau:  vector with lenght M containing desired window-sizes [in seconds]
%           If tau is not supplied then it is constructed such that each
%           decade has five points [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]. So, if S =sampling rate
%           default tau = [1/S, 2/S, 3/S, 5/S, 7/S, 10/S, 20/S..., MaxTau]
%            Where MaxTau is 7 units in the longest decade available for 
%            the given duration, or 70 seconds, whichever is less. 
%            For example, 
%            MaxTau = 0.07     for                  duration  <= 0.7 second
%            MaxTau = 0.7      for     0.7 second  < duration <= 7 seconds
%            MaxTau = 7        for       7 seconds < duration <= 70 seconds
%            MaxTau = 70       for      70 seconds < duration
%       
% Outputs:
%       msd: M x 1 vector containing msd value for each given window-length
%       Tau: M x 1 vector containing the actual 'tau' in units of seconds.
%               Output Tau is same as or really close to input tau.
%       ste_d: M x 1 vector containing standard error value for squared
%               displacement for each given window-length
%       ste_t: M x 1 vector containing standard error value for the window
%               lengths. Use this when time stamps are uneven.
%       count: M x 1 vector containing number of points that fell within each
%               window

    Nord = floor(log10(range(t))); %the order of the highest full decade
    Nord_maxpt = max(decapt)*10^Nord;
    if Nord_maxpt >= range(t)
        %ensure that longest tau is not longer than duration
