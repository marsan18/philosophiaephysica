2012-12-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: No longer a fatal error to input no data.  Now an error message is sent to display/logfile and an empty dataset is outputted instead.

	* msdstat.m:  better handling of "empty set" cases.
	* video_msd.m:  added 'window' to output msd structure.  better handling of "empty set" cases.

2011-08-09  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* getMSDslope.m:  now handles empty case for input parameters.
	* msd.m: removed 'winedge' parameter.  now keeps squared displacements "r^2" only the function is asked to output it.

	* msdstat.m: now handles empty case for input parameters.  added logentry capability.
	* plot_ve.m: same.
	* ve.m: same.

2011-07-20  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2011-07-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* video_msd.m:  assumes numeric input (in place of file names) has units of pixels (the same as if the file were loaded) and uses the calib_um accordingly.

2011-07-18  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* plot_msd.m: now returns the figure handle created/used when plotting the msd.
	* plot_ve.m: same.
	* video_msd.m: now it converts displacement data from 'pixels' to 'me' as it loads the data through 'load_video_tracking' instead of handling it on its own.

	* msdstat.m:  added.  handles computing statistics on msd datasets.
	* video_msd.m:  added back in the option to record each squared displacment.

2011-02-10  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* video_msd.m:  modified the scheme for determining tau windows.  The window input parameter, when a scalar denotes the number of window sizes desired from the minimum and maximum available (with repeats filtered out).  When 'window' is a vector, the old default behavior takes over, where the vector contains the exact window sizes of tau when computing the MSD. 

2011-01.13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* getMSDslope.m: added.  souped up way of computing alpha values that uses brian eastwoods edge_detector_1d code.  Originally Ricky Spero's code, I've tweaked it and added it here. Computing the GSER (ve.m) now uses this method.

2011-01-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: removed cvs diff text.
	* ve.m: same.

2011-01-13  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

	* plot_msd.m: also updated for new statistics measures and tweaked plots.
	* ve.m: changed to use the mean MSD as an imput instead of the individual MSD curves for each bead.  Takes advantage of weighted statistics to minimize bias/error.  Estimates error differently, now propagates max.min MSDs through the GSER function.
	* plot_ve.m: alse uses new stats measures and tweaked plots.
	
2010-09-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m:  added the 'winedge' functionality that limits each path to window sizes that are some factor smaller than the path length.  The default size is '1' that replicates previous behavior.  To restrict a path's windows to 80% of the path-length, set to '0.8'.
	* plot_msd.m: clarified documentation.
	* sim_msd.m: modified call to 'sim_newt_fluid' for the new 'numpaths' argument.
	* ve.m: added an argument that eliminates data points that have less than a desired population size.
	* video_msd.m: added usage of 'winedge' from msd.m and 'nmin' from ve.m.

2009-09-04 Ricky Spero <rspero@physics.unc.edu>
	* msdt.m Numerous minor modifications. Commented code, added x and y outputs for greater flexibility in usage.

2009-05-22  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>

2006-08-01  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* msdbase.m: 
	- Turned off interpolation when timestamps are uneven. Instead just warns on console and computes the error in Tau.
	- Reports error in Tau.
	* laser_msd_crossover.m:
	- Added. A utility that computes average msd for an ensemble of tracking files. 
	- Computes msd for bead position, position error and stage position and plots them to show crossover.

	- Essentially rewrote the whole module. Now allows to look at diffusion along each axis (X,Y,Z) as well as in each plane (XY, YZ, ZX) independently.
	- Output interface had to be changed to report 1D and 2D diffusion parameters
	- Corrected documentation to reflect changes in the interface.

	* rod_ve.m: same.

2006-01-21  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: switched to use of "NaN" functions so that it is no longer required for all trackers to exist for all known time points for mean-square displacement and viscoelastic methods.  The standard error reported by the code is weighted by the number of existing datapoints for each window size rather than the global number of trackers for the entire input dataset.
	* ve.m: same.

2005-06-30  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* msd.m: added.  Reimplemented algorithm for computing mean-square displacement as found in Mason's 2000 Rheol Acta paper.  Mostly done for better understanding of the algorithm, but placed here as it works cleanly with the new version of load_video_tracking.
