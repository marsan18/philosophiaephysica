Notes about TA Instruments output text file format

General Comments
- Lines are tab delimited with several different section types
  1. File Header section
  2. Global procedure header
  3. Specific procedure headers
  4. Geometry
  5. Rheometer Settings
  6-n. Data Sections, with header-lines that match Specific procedure header field named, "Step name"
- There exist some dashes in the parameter names.  These need to be replaced with '_' because the dashes drive matlab crazy (it thinks they are minus signs).

  
File Header Section  
- There are three main header lines with no delimiters
  1. Rheometer Company Identifier- "TA Instruments"
  2. filename
  3. date/time, format MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AP
- For the remainder of the entire file, with the exception of labels for data sections, lines with no delimiters are just whitespace, with zero length.


Global procedure Header
- Probably very stable, with standard parameter-value pairs.
- Starting this section is the parameter <Sample name>

Specific procedure headers
- Probably also very stable, with different sections for different test types.
- very important label, "step name" matches header label in data sections.


Geometry
- contains stable parameter-value pair info on specific geometry used in the experiment.


Rheometer Settings
- also parameter-value pairs
- there are sections within that contain data delimited by commas.  these "sub-sections" should be handled as such with the parent section defined in the line immediately prior to the sub-section.
- Subsections can be readily identified as single-tab lines with the tab located at position 1.


Data Sections
- These sections contain the actual numerical data for the procedure.
- Following a <Step name> is a column header line itself followed by a units line- Each section is identifiable by a zero-tab line with a string that matches a "step name" label from a previously defined specific procedure.
- data are listed, tab-delimited, with no non-numeric characters.


Notes about parsing design/algorithm
- identify sections by "stable" initial field name.
  - for the file header section, "TA Instruments"
  - for the global procedure section, "Sample name" or "procedure name"
  - Specific procedure- "step name"
  - Geometry- "Geometry name"
  - Rheometer Settings- "Sample compression"
  - Data sections- <step name>
- At a minimum you need to cut out the specific procedure parameters and associate them with the acquired data.
- Secondarily, you need the extraneous metadata for logbook purposes.
