	*.cvsignore: add *.mat files to list of ignore files
	* noise_expt.m: modified documentation to better match Mathworks convention
	* relaxation_time_expt.m: same
	* shear_rate_max.m: same
	* shear_wave_MCL_controller.m: same
	* shear_wave_MCL_oscillator.m: same
	* thinning_force.m: same

	* thinning_force_rod: added.  Given a Cross or Carreau model fit, this function generates force requirements that provides (offline) what force is necessary to achieve a desired shear rate(s) for a set of input ROD diameters.
	* thinningexpt_reqs_rod.m:  added.  Uses above to generate figure and reports force requirmeents for a driven bead thinning experiment.
	* thinning_force.m: added.  Fixed error in fitting function.
	* thinningexpt_reqs.m: added.  same.

	* noise_expt.m: updated call to zerodaq to accomdate new parameter.
	* shear_wave_MCL_controller.m: same.
	* shear_wave_MCL_oscillator.m: same.

2007-03-19  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* shear_rate_max.m: added.  converts a bead velocity into a maximum shear rate, located at the beads surface, normal to the flow direction.

2006-04-24  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* noise_expt.m:  added.  first pass at video tracking calibration and noise characterization.  Will be prettied up very soon.

2006-04-24  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* shear_wave_MCL_controller.m: removed extra zerodaq call that prematurely exited the expected normal run.

2005-11-11  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* shear_wave_MCL_controller.m: added.  extended version of oscillator that does additional testing types- constant velocity thus far.  more waveforms forthcoming....

2005-11-02  Kalpit Desai <kvdesai@email.unc.edu>
	* shear_wave_MCL_oscillator.m: Fixed the bug where stage would go to and come back before each session of data-acquisition.
2005-09-16  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* shear_wave_MCL_oscillator.m: added.  this script will oscillate the mad city labs stage in x or y while moving up or down in z.  This is used for the shear wave propagation experiments for mucus, etc...

2005-02-05  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time_expt.m:  added DAC control.
	* history_dependence_expt.m:  added reference to 'daqtest' for simulating signals.
 	* yield_stress_pulses_expt.m:  same.
 	* yield_stress_ramp_expt.m:  same.

2004-12-06  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* history_dependence_expt.m:  bugfix- wrong voltage variable referenced in method.

2004-10-31  Jeremy Cribb <jcribb@email.unc.edu>
	* relaxation_time_expt.m: added.  script that defines the driven bead microbead rheology experiment and places signals onto 3DFM magnets (6 pole design) for a given pole geometry. 
 	* history_dependence_expt.m: added.  same as above except for history dependence experiment type.
 	* yield_stress_pulses_expt.m: added.  same as above except for yield stress - pulses experiment type.
 	* yield_stress_ramp_expt.m: added.  same as above except for yield stress - ramp experiment type.
