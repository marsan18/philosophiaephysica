In dmbr_summaraize_data,
 - Need to reduce the inputs into a parameters structure... probably called "report_params"
 - components of report_params: nametag, scale, tau, capfile?
 - need to redo the loading protocol:  if vfd contains, evt file, vfcfile, and breakpoint, then load and process and report.  If dmbr file, load structure, then run report (can be called from GUI)
 - Generic approach:
    1. Load
    2. MAYBE_process- interactive with GUI, automatic (by script).
    3. Report- interactive (GUI figures, automatic (XML,HTML).

  - need to leave room to generalize for high throughput system (need cell coordinates)
  - Figure plotting should be handled through "plot_" functions
  - Figure saving should stay here as part of the report.
  - Computation should be computed through dmbr, not in reporting function.
  - Thoughts:  
    - need to inplement decision handling regarding plot types
    - need metalavel html files that link to data-level html files
    - need database generation of datasets and pages ____.

Loading the data:
  - the input filename could be:
      1. a "root" filename lacking extensions.
      2. vfd file that could:
	  a. contain references to other files.
	  b. or not.  others would need to be detected.
      3. dmbr file that should:
	  a. contain all raw data and any processed data.
	  b. contains metadata structure regarding those computations.
 
Once files are loaded, parameters need processing.

Parameter groups:
  - VFD parameters
  - Plotting parameters
  - DMBR paramters
  - Report parameters

Maybe, processing the data

available plots			required metadata		required data vectors
- displacement			(b)eadid, (s)eqid, (v)oltid	(t,x,y)
- displacement/force		(b,s,v)				(t,x,y, F)
- velocity			(b,s,v)				(t,x,y)
- maximum shear rate		(b,s,v) & (a)			(t,x-dot,y-dot)
- Weissenburg #			(b,s,v) & (a,tau)		(t,x-dot,y-dot)
- compliance			(b,s,v)	& (a,F)  FITS		(t,x-dot,y-dot)
- instantaneous velocity	(b,s,v)	& (a,F)			(t,x-dot,y-dot)
- strain thickening		(b,s,v)	& (a,F)			(t,x,x-dot,y-dot)
- inst visc vs max shear rate	(b,s,v)	& (a,F)  FITS		(t,x-dot,y-dot)
- inst visc vs weis num		(b,s,v) & (a,F,tau)		(t,x-dot,y-dot)
- yield stress

- rename "inst visc vs max shear" with "shear thinning"
- what about G? G', G'', look into Cox-Merz Rule

During ___		Fits (types)		Force {on/off}
- Compliance Space	Newtonian  [default]	(on)
			Maxwell 		(on/off) (maybe, doesn't really make sense in real situations)
			Kelvin-Voight 		(on/off)
			Jeffrey 		(on/off)
			Stretched Exponential 	(on/off)  (probably more off than on)
			Ke Model ???
			Relaxation Times 	(off)  (1-4 modes)
- Shear thinning space	Cross  (on)
			Carreau (on)
			Carreau/Yasuda (on)
- Yield stress space	Meter			(on)

Fit Structure- There must be commonality between fits structure but needs to be mutable because of fit types
  - Common: fit parameters as outputs, residuals, R^2
  - Diff: Output fit parameters change from fit-type to fit-type
  - possible structure definition:
      fit.
         .type
	 .param.
	       ."eta0" etc...
	 .residuals
	 .R2

Parameter needs (by fit type)
