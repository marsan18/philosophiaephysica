	* simple_levy_motion.m: changed to a function with limited input parameters.  now uses randomized locations for vortices and tracer starting positions.
	* vortex_vectors.m: updated comments.

	* simple_levy_motion.m:  fixed bug in determination of velocity vector.  The same velocity vector was added at each time step instead of being updated according to the tracer position at each time step.

	* simple_levy_motion.m:  changed default input parameters to make more physical sense.  Corrected scaling for 'gamma' values.
	* vortex_vectors.m: updated documentation.
	* VorticesStream.m: fixed bug where 'gamma' values were not tiled correctly.

	* streamparticlesARS.m: added.  Adam Shields's version of matlab's streamparticles function that includes a 'save' option for generating movie files.

	* vortex_vectors.m:  added.  Generates VX and VY, the x and y components of a vector field containing vortices at locations vls and vly.
	* VortexStream.m:  added.  Example method for modeling a vector field containing one vortex.  
	* VorticesStream.m:  added.  Generates vortical flow profiles for a number of vortices in a vector field.  Example code that uses VorticesStresm can be found at end of documentation. 
	* simple_levy_motion.m:  added.  generates particle paths for beads that diffuse within an vector field containing a number of vortices.  Uses 'vortex_vectors'.
	* run_varr.m:  added.  expands upon 'simple_levy_motion' to include ligands as the diffusing particles, as well as receptors.  Mature version of this will include collision detection for ligands (particles) to receptors.
