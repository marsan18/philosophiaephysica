% 3DFMAnalysis function  
% Modeling/Levy_flights 
%  
% This function generates the VX and VY components of a velocity vector field 
% that has within its boundaraies vortices located at VLX and VLY
% positions.  The vortex type may be 'irrotational' or 'rotational':
% Irrotational vortices, a.k.a. free vortices, are those in which fluid is 
% drawn down a drain (tub, whirlpool).  The other type, rotational vortices, 
% are also called force vortices, which occurs when the fluid just circulates.  
% The strength of each vortex is encapulated within 'gamma' but is really 
% the circulation strength in a irrotational vortex and the angular velocity 
% in rotational.
%   Refer to the function 'VorticesStream' as example code that uses
%   'vortex_vectors'. 
%  
% [vx,vy] = vortex_vectors(x,y,vlx,vly,gamma,vortex_type)

%  where "vx"  x-component of velocity vector field in [units]
%        "vy"  y-component of velocity vector field in [units]
%         "x"  x locations for vector field
%         "y"  y locations for vector field
%		 "vlx" x-locations for all defined vortices in [units]
%        "vly" y-locations for all defined vortices in [units]
%        "gamma"  circulation strength in [units] 
%        "vortex_type" can be 'irrotational' or 'rotational'
