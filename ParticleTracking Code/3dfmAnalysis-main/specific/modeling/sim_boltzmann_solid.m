% This function outputs the stochastic displacements over time for a bead in
% a boltzmann solid for a temperature in Kelvin. The modulus of the fluid, 
% the radius of the bead, the sampling_rate, and the duration of the data 
% collection are all needed for the approximation.  
%  
%  [displacement] = sim_boltzmann_solid(modulus, bead_radius, sampling_rate, duration, temp, dim)  
%   
%  where "modulus" is in [Pa] water is 2.2e9 Pa, glass is 35-55e9 Pa
%        "bead_radius" is in [m] 
%		 "sampling_rate" is in [Hz] 
%        "duration" is in [s]
%        "temp" is in [K]
%        "dim" is the dimension of diffusion (usually 1D, 2D, 3D)
%  
%  Notes:  
%   
%  - For results that truly approximate the bulk response of the material,
%  you need lots of repeats and averaging.
