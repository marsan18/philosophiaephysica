This fucntion takes an image as its input, and helps the user calculate the 
radius of curvature and lengs of different elements in the image.
It has three Main components. "rcmain.m" which is the main file. "setscale.m" 
which calculates scale of the image from a reference, and "rccalc.m" which
calculates the radius of curvature and length from 3 points. Image files must be in the rcCalc folder.
