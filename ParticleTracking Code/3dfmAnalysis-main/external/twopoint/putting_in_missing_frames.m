function[fullres] = putting_in_missing_frames(res)

% This program is used to insert 'fake' frames to replace those that are
% missing after running trackmem; that is to say the frames that were used
% as memory. The program makes a weighted average of the frame before and
% the frame after the missing frame(s). Hence, the feature is assumed to
% have followed a straight line between those points. The program is made
% to accept values of memory that can exceed 1. 
%
% INPUT : The matrix of displacements you get from trackmem.
% OUTPUT : The matrix now filled with these 'fake' frames.
